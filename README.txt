TreeVisis a simple Qt based tree graph visualizer.
In order to run you must add the files to a preexisting Qt environment, or change the makefile
included so it's comfigured to you Qt path.

The code creates and visualizes a 3-ary tree, implementing a generic, and you can also
make fitting classes for binary, 4-ary, or any k-ary tree you like.

It uses iterators so iterate over the tree in Pre, In and Post order, and also
iteratos for BFS and DFS scans of the tree.
